KÈNE AUDIT AI: CORE SYSTEM SPECIFICATION

1. MISSION CRITICAL CONTEXT

Kène Audit AI is the Primary Lead Acquisition System for my business. It is a high-stakes consultative tool used to bridge the gap between a prospect's current manual mess and my high-ticket infrastructure solutions (Websites, Automations, Scrapers, and Dashboards).

The Workflow: I use this tool during live consultations or deep research phases. I input specific business intelligence, and the system generates a "Strategic Roadmap" that makes my services look like a mandatory investment.

2. THE TARGET AUDIENCE (LEADS)

We target established businesses that are "scaling but breaking."

Logistics:

Retail/ ecom

Manufacturing

real-estate/ home improvement/development

hospitality

The Pitch Goal: The audit must make the lead feel that not hiring me is costing them more than my fee.

3. CORE SYSTEM LOGIC & AI PROMPTING

When implementing features or AI prompts, the coding agent must adhere to:

Diagnostic-First Approach: The AI should never be "generic." It must identify specific industry-standard leakages based on the intel I provide.

Quantitative ROI: Every audit must produce "Impact Metrics"—Time Reclaimed (Hours/Mo) and Revenue Lift (%).

High-Status Copy: The tone is "Consultative Architect," not "Freelancer." Use simple non technical terms that are business oriented

4. UI/UX STANDARDS (THE "APPLE" DIRECTIVE)

The UI is as important as the logic. It must command a premium price.

Aesthetic: Minimalist, high-fidelity, "Apple-style" dark mode.

Colors: - Base: #050505 (Deep, rich black).

Accent: #e2b619 (Kène Gold).

Contrast: Pure White for key summaries.

Key Elements:

Extreme rounded corners (2.5rem+).

Glassmorphism/Translucency on cards.

Fluid, cinematic transitions between "Discovery" and "Report."

Visual placeholders for "AI Processing" to build perceived value.

5. REPOSITORY & FEATURE RULES

Scalability: The "Discovery" phase must be modular so I can add new industry categories (e.g., Real Estate, Hospitality) easily.

CTA Focus: Every audit ends with a WhatsApp-integrated "Deployment" button that carries the business data forward. (+2348061952248)

6. CODING AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

When I ask you to "update the UI" or "implement a new category," you must:

Ensure the new fields collect deep data (not surface-level).

Update the Gemini System Instruction to recognize the new industry context.

Maintain the "Kène Gold" premium visual standards.

Ensure the output JSON always maps correctly to the visual cards and charts.
